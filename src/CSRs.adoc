[[CSRs]]
== Control and Status Registers (CSRs) Added to Harts

For each privilege level at which a hart can take interrupt traps, the
Advanced Interrupt Architecture adds CSRs for interrupt control and
handling.

=== Machine-level CSRs

<<CSRs-M>> lists both the CSRs added for machine
level and existing machine-level CSRs whose size is changed by the
Advanced Interrupt Architecture. Existing CSRs `mie`, `mip`, and `mideleg` are widended to 64 bits to support a total of 64 interrupt causes.

For RV32, the _high-half_ CSRs listed in the table allow access to the
upper 32 bits of registers `mideleg`, `mie`, `mvien`, `mvip`, and `mip`. The Advanced Interrupt Architecture requires that these high-half CSRs exist for RV32, but the bits they access may all be merely read-only zeros.

CSRs `miselect` and `mireg` provide a window for accessing multiple registers beyond the CSRs in <<CSRs-M>>. The value of `miselect` determines which
register is currently accessible through alias CSR `mireg`. `miselect` is a *WARL* register, and it must support a minimum range of values depending on the implemented features. When an IMSIC is not implemented, `miselect` must be able to hold at least any 6-bit value in the range 0 to 0``x3F``. When an IMSIC is implemented, `miselect` must be able to hold any 8-bit value in the range 0 to 0``xFF``. Values for `miselect` in the range 0 to 0``xFF`` are currently assigned in subranges as follows:

``0x00-0x2F`` reserved
``0x30-0x3F`` major interrupt priorities
``0x40-0x6F`` reserved
``0x70–0xFF`` external interrupts (only with an IMSIC)

`miselect` may also support values outside the range 0x00-0``xFF``, though no standard
registers are currently allocated to values above .

|===

Values of `miselect` with the most-significant bit set (bit
`XLEN - 1` = `1`) are designated for custom use,
presumably for accessing custom registers through `mireg`. If `XLEN` changes, the
most-significant bit of `miselect` moves to the new position, retaining its value
from before. An implementation is not required to support any custom
values for `miselect`.

When `miselect` is a number in a reserved range (currently 0x00-0x2F, 0x40-0x6F or a number above 0xFF
not designated for custom use), attempts to access `mireg` will typically raise
an illegal instruction exception.

Normally, the range for external interrupts, 0x70-0xFF, is populated only when
an IMSIC is implemented; else, attempts to access `mireg` when `miselect` is in this range
also cause an illegal instruction exception. The contents of the
external-interrupts region are documented in
<<IMSIC>> on the IMSIC.

CSR `mtopei` also exists only when an IMSIC is implemented, so is documented in
<<IMSIC>> along with the indirectly accessed IMSIC
registers.

CSR `mtopi` reports the highest-priority interrupt that is pending and enabled
for machine level, as specified in <<mtopi>>.

When S-mode is implemented, CSRs `mvien` and `mvip` support interrupt filtering and
virtual interrupts for supervisor level. These facilities are explained
in <<virtIntrs-S>>.

If extension Smcsrind is also implemented, then when `miselect` has a value in the
range 0x30-0x3F
or 0x70-0xFF, attempts to access alias CSRs `mireg2` through `mireg6` raise an illegal
instruction exception.

=== Supervisor-level CSRs

<<CSRs-S>> lists the supervisor-level CSRs that are
added and existing CSRs that are widened to 64 bits, if the hart
implements S-mode. The functions of these registers all match their
machine-level counterparts.

|===

The space of registers accessible through the `siselect`/`sireg` window is separate from
but parallels that of machine level, being for supervisor-level
interrupts instead of machine-level interrupts. The allocated values for
`siselect` in the range 0 to 0xFF to are once again these:

0x00-0x2F reserved
0x30-0x3F major interrupt priorities
0x40-0x6F reserved
0x70-0xFF external interrupts (only with an IMSIC)

For maximum compatibility, it is recommended that `siselect` support at least a
9-bit range, 0 to
0x1FF, regardless of whether an IMSIC exists.
[NOTE]
====
Because the VS CSR `vsiselect` (<<CSRs-hypervisor>>) always has at
least 9 bits, and like other VS CSRs, `vsiselect` substitutes for `siselect` when executing in
a virtual machine (VS-mode or VU-mode), implementing a smaller range for
`siselect` allows software to discover it is not running in a virtual machine.
====

Like `miselect`, values of `siselect` with the most-significant bit set (bit
XLEN - 1 = 1) are designated for custom use.
If XLEN changes, the most-significant bit of `siselect` moves to the new position,
retaining its value from before. An implementation is not required to
support any custom values for `siselect`.

When `siselect` is a number in a reserved range (currently  0x00-0x2F, 0x40-0x6F,or a number above 0xFF
not designated for custom use), or in the range 0x70-0xFF when there is no
IMSIC, attempts to access 'sireg' should preferably raise an illegal instruction
exception (unless executing in a virtual machine, covered in the next
section).

Note that the widths of 'siselect' and 'sireg' are always the current XLEN rather than
SXLEN. Hence, for example, if MXLEN = 64 and SXLEN = 32, then these
registers are 64 bits when the current privilege mode is M (running RV64
code) but 32 bits when the privilege mode is S (RV32 code).

CSR `stopei` is described with the IMSIC in <<IMSIC>>.

Register `stopi` reports the highest-priority interrupt that is pending and
enabled for supervisor level, as specified in
<<stopi>>.

If extension Sscsrind is also implemented, then when `siselect` has a value in the 0x30–0x3F or 0x70–0xFF range attempts to access alias CSRs `sireg2` through `sireg6` raise an illegal
instruction exception (unless executing in a virtual machine, covered in
the next section).

=== Hypervisor and VS CSRs

If a hart implements the Privileged Architecture’s hypervisor extension,
then the hypervisor and VS CSRs listed in
Table #tab:CSRs-hypervisor[[tab:CSRs-hypervisor]] are also either added
or widened to 64 bits.

The new hypervisor CSRs in the table (, , , and ) augment for injecting
interrupts into VS level. The use of these registers is covered in
Chapter #ch:VSLevel[[ch:VSLevel]] on interrupts for virtual machines.

The new VS CSRs (, , , and ) all match supervisor CSRs, and substitute
for those supervisor CSRs when executing in a virtual machine (in
VS-mode or VU-mode).

CSR is required to support at least a 9-bit range of 0 to , whether or
not an IMSIC is implemented. As with , values of with the
most-significant bit set (bit latexmath:[$\mbox{XLEN - 1} = \mbox{1}$])
are designated for custom use. If XLEN changes, the most-significant bit
of moves to the new position, retaining its value from before.

Like and , the widths of and are always the current XLEN rather than
VSXLEN. Hence, for example, if HSXLEN = 64 and VSXLEN = 32, then these
registers are 64 bits when accessed by a hypervisor in HS-mode (running
RV64 code) but 32 bits for a guest OS in VS-mode (RV32 code).

The space of registers selectable by is more limited than for machine
and supervisor levels:

– & reserved +
– & inaccessible +
– & reserved +
– & external interrupts (IMSIC only), or inaccessible +
– & reserved +

For alias CSRs and , the hypervisor extension’s usual rules for when to
raise a virtual instruction exception (based on whether an instruction
is _HS-qualified_) are not applicable. The rules given in this section
for and apply instead, unless overridden by the requirements of
Section #sec:CSRs-stateen[1.5], which take precedence over this section
when extension Smstateen is also implemented.

A virtual instruction exception is raised for attempts from VS-mode or
VU-mode to directly access , or attempts from VU-mode to access .

When has a reserved value (including values above not designated for
custom use), attempts from M-mode or HS-mode to access , or from VS-mode
to access (really ), should preferably raise an illegal instruction
exception.

When has the number of an _inaccessible_ register, attempts from M-mode
or HS-mode to access raise an illegal instruction exception, and
attempts from VS-mode to access (really ) raise a virtual instruction
exception.

Requiring a range of 0– for , even though most or all of the space is
reserved or inaccessible, permits a hypervisor to emulate indirectly
accessed registers in the implemented range, including registers that
may be standardized in the future at locations –.

The indirectly accessed registers for external interrupts (numbers –)
are accessible only when field VGEIN of is the number of an implemented
guest external interrupt, not zero. If VGEIN is not the number of an
implemented guest external interrupt (including the case when no IMSIC
is implemented), then all indirect register numbers in the ranges – and
– designate an inaccessible register at VS level.

Along the same lines, when .VGEIN is not the number of an implemented
guest external interrupt, attempts from M-mode or HS-mode to access CSR
raise an illegal instruction exception, and attempts from VS-mode to
access raise a virtual instruction exception.

If extension Sscsrind is also implemented, then when has a value in the
range – or –, attempts from M-mode or HS-mode to access alias CSRs
through raise an illegal instruction exception, and attempts from
VS-mode to access through raise a virtual instruction exception.

=== Virtual instruction exceptions

Following the default rules for the hypervisor extension, attempts from
VS-mode to directly access a hypervisor or VS CSR other than , or from
VU-mode to access any supervisor-level CSR (including hypervisor and VS
CSRs) other than or , usually raise not an illegal instruction exception
but instead a virtual instruction exception. For details, see the
Privileged Architecture.

Instructions that read/write CSR or are considered to be _HS-qualified_
unless all of following are true: the hart has an IMSIC, extension
Smstateen is implemented, and bit 58 of is zero. (See the next section,
#sec:CSRs-stateen[1.5], about .)

For and , see both the previous section, #ch:CSRs-hypervisor[1.3], and
the next, #sec:CSRs-stateen[1.5], for when a virtual instruction
exception is required instead of an illegal instruction exception.

[[sec:CSRs-stateen]]
=== Access control by the state-enable CSRs

If extension Smstateen is implemented together with the Advanced
Interrupt Architecture (AIA), three bits of state-enable register
control access to AIA-added state from privilege modes less privileged
than M-mode:

bit 60 & CSRs , , , and +
bit 59 & all other state added by the AIA and not controlled by bits 60
and 58 +
bit 58 & all IMSIC state, including CSRs and +

If one of these bits is zero in , an attempt to access the corresponding
state from a privilege mode less privileged than M-mode results in an
illegal instruction trap. As always, the state-enable CSRs do not affect
the accessibility of any state when in M-mode, only in less privileged
modes. For more explanation, see the documentation for extension
Smstateen.

Bit 59 controls access to AIA CSRs , , , , /, , , /, /, , , and , as
well as to the supervisor-level interrupt priorities accessed through +
(the array of Section #sec:intrPrios-S[[sec:intrPrios-S]]).

Bit 58 is implemented in only if the hart has an IMSIC. If the
hypervisor extension is also implemented, this bit does not affect the
behavior or accessibility of hypervisor CSRs and , or field VGEIN of .
In particular, guest external interrupts from an IMSIC continue to be
visible to HS-mode in even when bit 58 of is zero.

An earlier, pre-ratification draft of Smstateen said that when bit 58 of
is zero, registers and and field VGEIN of are all read-only zeros. That
effect is no longer correct.

If the hart does not have an IMSIC, bit 58 of is read-only zero, but
Smstateen has no effect on attempts to access the nonexistent IMSIC
state.

This means in particular that, when the hart does not have an IMSIC, the
following raise a virtual instruction exception as described in
Section #ch:CSRs-hypervisor[1.3], not an illegal instruction exception,
despite that bit 58 of is zero:

attempts from VS-mode to access (really ) while has a value in the range
–; and

attempts from VS-mode to access (really ).

If bit 60 of is one, then regardless of any other bits (including bits
58 and 59 of ), a virtual instruction exception is raised as described
in Section #ch:CSRs-hypervisor[1.3] for all attempts from VS-mode or
VU-mode to directly access , and for all attempts from VU-mode to access
. This behavior is overridden only when bit 60 of is zero.

If the hypervisor extension is implemented, the same three bits are
defined also in hypervisor CSR but concern only the state potentially
accessible to a virtual machine executing in privilege modes VS and VU:

bit 60 & CSRs and (really and ) +
bit 59 & CSRs and (RV32 only) and (really , , and ) +
bit 58 & all state of IMSIC guest interrupt files, including CSR (really
) +

If one of these bits is zero in , and the same bit is one in , then an
attempt to access the corresponding state from VS or VU-mode raises a
virtual instruction exception. (But note that, for high-half CSRs and ,
this applies only when XLEN = 32. When
latexmath:[$\mbox{XLEN} > \mbox{32}$], an attempt to access or raises an
illegal instruction exception as usual, not a virtual instruction
exception.)

If bit 60 is one in but is zero in , then all attempts from VS or
VU-mode to access or raise a virtual instruction exception, not an
illegal instruction exception, regardless of the value of or any other
bits.

Bit 58 is implemented in only if the hart has an IMSIC. Furthermore,
even with an IMSIC, bit 58 may (or may not) be read-only zero in if the
IMSIC has no _guest interrupt files_ for guest external interrupts
(Chapter #ch:IMSIC[[ch:IMSIC]]). When this bit is zero (whether
read-only zero or set to zero), a virtual machine is prevented from
accessing the hart’s IMSIC the same as when .VGEIN = 0.

Extension Ssstateen is defined as the supervisor-level view of
Smstateen. Therefore, the combination of Ssaia and Ssstateen
incorporates the bits defined above for but not those for , since
machine-level CSRs are not visible to supervisor level.
